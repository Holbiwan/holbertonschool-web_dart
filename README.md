## Introduction

This repository introduces you to Dart, a versatile programming language ideal for client-side development on web and mobile platforms. Through this project, you’ll explore Dart’s powerful features and learn to build robust applications with its simple syntax and modern capabilities.
What is Dart?

Dart is a programming language developed by Google, primarily designed for building client applications, especially for web and mobile. It’s also well-suited for server-side and desktop applications. Dart is:

    Object-oriented and class-based
    Garbage-collected, which automatically manages memory
    Structured with C-style syntax, making it intuitive for developers familiar with similar languages


Installation and Running Dart
